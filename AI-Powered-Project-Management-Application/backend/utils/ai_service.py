2. The number of phases and tasks must be dynamically determined based on project complexity:
   - Low complexity: 3-4 phases with 2-3 tasks each
   - Medium complexity: 4-5 phases with 3-4 tasks each
   - High complexity: 5-7 phases with 4-6 tasks each
3. For tight deadlines (under 30 days), prioritize essential development tasks and create a fast-tracked plan

4. Structure phases according to standard software development lifecycle:
   - Include initial phases for planning, requirements gathering, and design
   - Include middle phases for development, testing, and integration
   - Include final phases for deployment, documentation, and maintenance
   
5. MUST incorporate industry best practices relevant to the project:
   - For {methodology} projects, include specific methodology elements
   - Include necessary testing stages (unit, integration, system, user acceptance)
   - Include DevOps practices where relevant (CI/CD, infrastructure as code)
   - For AI/ML projects, include data processing and model training steps

6. Provide realistic time estimates for each task that:
   - Account for the project's total available time of {days_remaining if days_remaining is not None else 'unknown'} days
   - Allocate time proportionally based on task complexity and importance
   - Include buffer time for unexpected issues and revisions
   
7. Ensure each task is:
   - Specific to software development (NO generic market research, presentations, etc.)
   - Actionable and measurable
   - Technical in nature with clear deliverables
   - Described with software development terminology and concepts

8. IMPORTANT: This is a unique request (timestamp: {timestamp}, seed: {random_seed}). Do not provide a generic or templated roadmap. Create a completely fresh and unique roadmap specific to this project's needs.

The roadmap MUST be uniquely tailored to this specific software project, not a generic template.
