## Detailed Setup Process

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment (if not already created)
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Add the following environment variables (adjust as needed):
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
     REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
     ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   # From the backend directory
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   # From the frontend directory
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Application Functionality

### Authentication System

The application includes a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system:

1. **Login**
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Enter your email and password
   - The system will authenticate and redirect to the dashboard

2. **Signup**
   - Navigate to the signup page
   - Enter your full name, email, and password
   - Create a new account

3. **Persistent Sessions**
   - Authentication state is maintained across browser sessions
   - User data is stored securely in JWT tokens

### Dashboard

The dashboard is your central hub for tracking projects and activities:

1. **Accessing the Dashboard**
   - The dashboard is the default landing page after login
   - Alternatively, click the Dashboard icon in the sidebar

2. **Dashboard Features**
   - **Project Cards**: Shows all your projects with progress indicators
   - **Recent Activity**: Track updates to your projects
   - **Priority Indicators**: Color-coded priority levels (high, medium, low)
   - **Deadline Tracking**: Visual indicators for approaching deadlines

3. **Navigation**
   - Click on any project card to navigate to that project's details
   - Use the sidebar to navigate to other application areas

## Technical Architecture

The application is built with a modern technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React, Material UI, Context API for state management
- **Backend**: Python RESTful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication
- **AI Integration**: External AI service for roadmap generation
- **PDF Generation**: Server-side PDF report creation

## API Reference

Key API endpoints include:

- **Authentication**
  - POST `/api/auth/signup`: Register a new user
  - POST `/api/auth/login`: Authenticate user and get token

- **Organizations**
  - GET `/api/organizations`: List user organizations
  - POST `/api/organizations`: Create new organization
  - GET `/api/organizations/:id`: Get organization details

- **Projects**
  - GET `/api/organizations/:orgId/projects`: List organization projects
  - POST `/api/organizations/:orgId/projects`: Create new project
  - GET `/api/projects/:id`: Get project details

- **Tasks**
  - GET `/api/projects/:projectId/tasks`: Get project tasks
  - PUT `/api/projects/:projectId/tasks`: Update tasks progress

- **AI & Reports**
  - POST `/api/generate-roadmap`: Generate AI roadmap
  - GET `/api/projects/:id/generate-report`: Generate project report

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: "Invalid credentials" error
- **Solution**: Verify your email and password are correct. Reset password if necessary.

### Roadmap Generation
- **Problem**: Empty or inadequate roadmap
- **Solution**: Provide more detailed project description and problem statement.

### Task Progress Not Saving
- **Problem**: Task progress not persisting to database
- **Solution**: Check internet connection. Progress is saved locally and will sync when connection is restored.

### Report Generation Failures
- **Problem**: Report generation fails
- **Solution**: Ensure the project has sufficient data (tasks, roadmap) for generating a meaningful report.
